    # state.is_goal_state() - Returns true if the state is a goal state.
    # state.extract_plan() - Returns the list of actions used to reach this state.
    # state.get_expanded_states() - Returns a list containing the states reachable from the current state.
    # You should also take a look at frontier.py to see which methods the Frontier interface exposes
    #
    # print_search_status(expanded, frontier): As you can see below, the code will print out status
    # (#expanded states, size of the frontier, #generated states, total time used) for every 1000th node
    # generated.
    # You should also make sure to print out these stats when a solution has been found, so you can keep
    # track of the exact total number of states generated!!
